# 🔌 DLLPluginLoader

A powerful DLL loader for a wide range of PC games — now confirmed to support **IW8 1.38 (Modern Warfare 2019)**.  
It works by hijacking `bink2w64.dll` to load custom `.dll` plugins into the game at runtime.

---

## 🧠 What It Does

- Replaces `bink2w64.dll` to inject your own `.dll` plugin into the game.
- Enables debugging, modding, and runtime customization.
- Ideal for advanced users and developers working on IW8 engine-based games like **MW2019**.
